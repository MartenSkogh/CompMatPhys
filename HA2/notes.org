* Simulation parameters
** Basis
Use plane waves, they give the best accuracy according to lecture notes.

** k
Check convergence

** Cross correlation function
Use PBE, I don't know why really

** Plan wave cut-off
Check convergence for different values.

The simulation won't run, only gives me the error 'You have a weird unit cell!'. I think the error comes when you have a certain cut-off energies, there might be a k-dependence here that fucks everything up as well.

** Lattice parameter
Start with a table value for the lattice parameter then calculate a more accurate value.
